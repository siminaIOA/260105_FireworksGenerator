## Features
- Many blast patterns with strong spherical bias and distinct shapes
- Curved, swirled, and spiral trajectories with long-trail variants
- Bright flash pop on most detonations matching the firework hue
- Occasional multi-blast bursts for secondary particle detonations
- Crisp circular particles with dotted or line-based trails

## Getting Started

2. `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`
